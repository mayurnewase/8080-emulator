4 roms are available which should be loaded in memory at following addresses
    invaders.h 0000-07ff
    invaders.g 0800-0fff
    invaders.f 1000-17ff
    invaders.e 1800-1fff

Video output:
    raster resolution is 256*224 pixels at 60Hz.
    monitor is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise.
    screen pixels are either on/off, no colors.
        so each pixel is 1 bit, so total size of 1 frame = 256*224 bits = 57344 bits or 7168 bytes

memory layout:
    0000-1fff = all 4 roms
    2000-23ff = ram
    2400-3fff = video ram
    4000 = ram mirror

// TODOs:
    convert all rams into assembly code
    then understand the code
